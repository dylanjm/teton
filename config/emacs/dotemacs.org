* About

This document is my current emacs config which contains the code for my =early-init.el= file and =init.el= file. You may be wondering how one file can contain code for two different configuration files. Through the power of =org-babel-tangle=, I am able to configure and document my entire emacs experience in a single Org file. There are several reasons to organize one's configuration this way. I hope these reasons become obvious as you browse through, but personally I find it much easier to document my choices using a markup language. This way I can store links and reference back to forum threads and other places when updating. I can also include pictures throughout and organize code-blocks with specific names to make navigation quick and painless. If you're interested in creating a similar setup, take a look at the raw-version of this file. There is important information contained in the header and throughout the file to make this work. Once you have a proper the proper settings, start adding src-blocks and then run =M-x org-babel-tangle <RET>=. Your config files will then be generated and Emacs will use those files when starting up. I have also written a hook that tangles this file everytime I save.

** Garbage Collection

You'll see this modification in many config files around the internet. The idea is that emacs sets it's memory threshold 40 years in the past. This causes the garbage collector to run frequently and can cause delays or muck up the speed of your setup. We pretty much disable garbage collection during the initial phase to improve our startup time. After we have given enough time for everything to load we then set the gc-theshold to a reasonable number. Sometimes people set the threshold back to its default value, but I keep it a little higher to handle things like fuzzy completion and language-server requirements.

** Pre-Gui Optimization

Ever since Emacs 27.0 we can utilize the early-init file to setup a few graphical settings without seeing a major slow down. The biggest speed ups I've seen from this is setting =vertical-scroll-bars= , =ns-appearance=, and =ns-transparent-titlebar=. I also set the font during this time and handle a few other graphical settings.

** Package Management
*** [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]]

=Straight.el= is my package manager of choice. It is extremely powerful in it's design and ensures you have a functional Emacs config. There are a few peculiar things about this package, but overall I prefer this setup much more to anything I've tried.

#+name: early-init-straight-block

*** [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][Use-Package]]

Use-Package is nearly ubiquitous in an Emacs config these days.

** Initial Demands

This section is for packages I need immediately upon launching emacs. My goal is to slim this section down a lot to try to further improve startup-times.

*** [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][Exec-Path-From-Shell]]

Application launching on MacOS isn't handled by a specific system. This makes it really hard to get envrionment variables from your shell to show up  in Emacs. This package makes that easier.

*** [[https://github.com/raxod502/el-patch][El-Patch]]

Great package by the same author of Straight.el. It's similar to adding advice to functions but with a twist. Helpful if you need to future proof your emacs or need to alter a function from a package.

#+name: init-el-patch-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][General]]

Great package for managing key-bindings and other customizations.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package general
  :demand t
  :straight t)
#+end_src

*** [[https://github.com/raxod502/blackout][Blackout]]

Similar to packages like =minions=, =diminish=, or =delight=. You can alter how your minor and major modes show up in the mode-line.

#+name: init-blackout-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package blackout
  :demand t
  :straight (:host github :repo "raxod502/blackout"))

*** [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][Emacs-Lisp Libraries]]

Great Elisp library used throughout my config

#+name: init-emacs-lisp-libraries-block

(use-package cl-lib

  :straight (:type built-in))
#+end_src

*** [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/][Org-Plus-Contrib]]

We need to intercept the built-in org-version that ships with emacs. For some reason we have to do this early. I'm not really sure why though.

#+name: init-org-plus-contrib-block

*** Functions
**** Active-Intervals

This function is a great way to conditional run functions at different intervals. For example, take a look at my =recentf= config. Code taken from [[https://github.com/noctuid/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/awaken.org][noctuid dotfiles.]]

#+name: init-active-interval-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defmacro arco/run-at-active-interval (interval idle-interval &rest body)
  "Every INTERVAL seconds, unless idle for > IDLE-INTERVAL seconds, run BODY.
Also, after IDLE-INTERVAL seconds of idle time, run BODY. This allows using an
idle timer to quickly run BODY when Emacs becomes idle but also ensures that
BODY is run periodically even if Emacs is actively being used."
  (declare (indent 2))
  `(progn
     (run-at-time (current-time) ,interval
                  (lambda ()
                    (let* ((idle-time (current-idle-time))

     (run-with-idle-timer ,idle-interval t (lambda () ,@body))))
#+end_src

**** Screen-Capture

A quick work around function to easily snap screenshots of lecture videos while taking notes. Use the prefix command =C-u M-x emacs-screen-capture RET= to insert it automatically as an org link.

#+name: init-screen-capture-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

**** Protect Buffers

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(el-patch-defun eval-print-last-sexp (&optional eval-last-sexp-arg-internal)
  "Evaluate sexp before point; print value into current buffer.

Normally, this function truncates long output according to the value
of the variables `eval-expression-print-length' and
`eval-expression-print-level'.  With a prefix argument of zero,
however, there is no such truncation.  Such a prefix argument
also causes integers to be printed in several additional formats
\(octal, hexadecimal, and character).

If `eval-expression-debug-on-error' is non-nil, which is the default,
this command arranges for all errors to enter the debugger.

[El-Patch] Adds a ';; ' before printing the output to the buffer."
