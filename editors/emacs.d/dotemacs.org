** Literate Programming in Org

This document is my current emacs config which contains the code for my =early-init.el= file and =init.el= file. You may be wondering how one file can contain code for two different configuration files. Through the power of =org-babel-tangle=, I am able to configure and document my entire emacs experience in a single Org file. There are several reasons to organize one's configuration this way. I hope these reasons become obvious as you browse through, but personally I find it much easier to document my choices using a markup language. This way I can store links and reference back to forum threads and other places when updating. I can also include pictures throughout and organize code-blocks with specific names to make navigation quick and painless. If you're interested in creating a similar setup, take a look at the raw-version of this file. There is important information contained in the header and throughout the file to make this work. Once you have a proper the proper settings, start adding src-blocks and then run =M-x org-babel-tangle <RET>=. Your config files will then be generated and Emacs will use those files when starting up. I have also written a hook that tangles this file everytime I save.

** Preliminary Configuration

You'll see a similar configuration in other dotfiles online. By default, Emac's runs it garbage collector when the

*** Garbage Collection

You'll see this modification in many config files around the internet. The idea is that emacs sets it's memory threshold 40 years in the past. This causes the garbage collector to run frequently and can cause delays or muck up the speed of your setup. We pretty much disable garbage collection during the initial phase to improve our startup time. After we have given enough time for everything to load we then set the gc-theshold to a reasonable number. Sometimes people set the threshold back to its default value, but I keep it a little higher to handle things like fuzzy completion. The FLX README suggest we do this to keep emacs running nice and smooth.

*** Pre-Gui Optimization

Ever since Emacs 27.0 we can utilize the early-init file to setup a few graphical settings without seeing a major slow down. The biggest speed ups I've seen from this is setting =vertical-scroll-bars= , =ns-appearance=, and =ns-transparent-titlebar=. I also set the font during this time and handle a few other graphical settings.

#+name: early-init-pre-gui-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default initial-frame-alist '((window-right-divider-width . 20)
                                      (window-bottom-divider-width . 20)))

  (setq-default default-frame-alist '((ns-transparent-titlebar . t)
                                      (alpha . (100 100))

                                      (ns-appearance . dark)
                                      (vertical-scroll-bars)
                                      (font . "Iosevka TermLig SS09-18:weight=ultra-light:width=expanded")))

** Package Management
*** [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]]

Straight.el is my package manager of choice. It is extremely powerful in it's design and ensures you have a functional Emacs config. There are a few peculiar things about this package, but overall I prefer this setup much more to anything I've tried.

#+name: early-init-straight-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (eval-and-compile
    (defvar straight-recipes-gnu-elpa-use-mirror t)
    (defvar bootstrap-version 5)
    (defvar bootstrap-file
      (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory)))

  (setq-default straight-cache-autoloads t
                straight-recipe-overrides nil
                straight-repository-branch "develop"
                straight-use-package-by-default t
                straight-check-for-modifications '(check-on-save find-when-checking))

  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))

  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage)
#+end_src

*** [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][Use-Package]]

Use-Package is nearly ubiquitous in an Emacs config these days. Once you spend the time on learning how to leverage the package strengths, it's almost impossible to think of doing your config any other way. There are some people who choose not to use this package. They believe that it abstracts too much away from the user. I think they have a point. There may be a day I can move past relying on Use-Package. Until then, it's a great way to organize and setup a config.

#+name: init-block-use-package-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default use-package-verbose nil
                use-package-always-defer t
                use-package-compute-statistics nil

** Initial Demands

This section is for packages I need immediately upon launching emacs. My goal is to slim this section down a lot to try to further improve startup-times.

*** [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][Exec-Path-From-Shell]]

Application launching on MacOS isn't handled by a specific system. This makes it really hard to get envrionment variables from your shell to show up  in Emacs. This package makes that easier.

*** [[https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering][No-Littering]]

Not super stoked on using this package, as I might replace it later with my own setup, but until then it's a good way to keep your emacs directory clean.

#+name: init-no-littering-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** [[https://github.com/raxod502/el-patch][El-Patch]]

Great package by the same author of Straight.el. It's similar to adding advice to functions but with a twist. Helpful if you need to future proof your emacs or need to alter a function from a package.

#+name: init-el-patch-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package el-patch
    :demand t
    :straight t)
#+end_src

*** [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][General]]

Great package for managing key-bindings and other customizations.

#+name: init-general-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package general
    :demand t
    :straight t)
#+end_src

*** [[https://github.com/raxod502/blackout][Blackout]]

Similar to packages like minions, diminish, or delight. You can alter how your minor and major modes show up in the mode-line.

#+name: init-blackout-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package blackout
    :demand t
    :straight (:host github :repo "raxod502/blackout"))

*** [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][Dash]]

Great Elisp library that I use throughout my config.

#+name: init-dash-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dash
    :demand t
    :straight t)
#+end_src

*** [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][F]]

Great Elisp library used throughout my config

#+name: init-f-block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package f
    :demand t
    :straight t)

  (use-package s
    :demand t
    :straight t)
#+end_src

*** [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/][Org-Plus-Contrib]]

We need to intercept the built-in org-version that ships with emacs. For some reason we have to do this early. I'm not really sure why though.

#+name: ini-org-plus-contrib-block

*** Functions
**** Active-Intervals

This function is a great way to conditional run functions at different intervals. For example, take a look at my =recentf= config. Code taken from [[https://github.com/noctuid/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/awaken.org][noctuid dotfiles.]]

  (el-patch-defun lisp-indent-function (indent-point state)
    "This function is the normal value of the variable `lisp-indent-function'.
  The function `calculate-lisp-indent' calls this to determine
  if the arguments of a Lisp function call should be indented specially.

  INDENT-POINT is the position at which the line being indented begins.
  Point is located at the point to indent under (for default indentation);
  STATE is the `parse-partial-sexp' state for that position.

  If the current line is in a call to a Lisp function that has a non-nil
  property `lisp-indent-function' (or the deprecated `lisp-indent-hook'),
  it specifies how to indent.  The property value can be:

  ,* `defun', meaning indent `defun'-style
    (this is also the case if there is no property and the function
    has a name that begins with \"def\", and three or more arguments);

  ,* an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments specially
    (like ordinary function arguments), and then indent any further
    arguments like a body;

  ,* a function to call that returns the indentation (or nil).
    `lisp-indent-function' calls this function with the same two arguments
    that it itself received.

  This function returns either the indentation to use, or nil if the
  Lisp function does not specify a special indentation."
