## BETTER DIRECTORY NAVIGATION ##

# Prepend cd to directory names automatically
shopt -s autocd 2> /dev/null
# Correct spelling errors during tab-completion
shopt -s dirspell 2> /dev/null
# Correct spelling errors in arguments supplied to cd
shopt -s cdspell 2> /dev/null

# This defines where cd looks for targets
# Add the directories you want to have fast access to, separated by colon
# Ex: CDPATH=".:~:~/projects" will look for targets in the current working directory, in home and in the ~/projects folder
CDPATH="."

# This allows you to bookmark your favorite places across the file system
# Define a variable containing a path and you will be able to cd into it regardless of the directory you're in
shopt -s cdable_vars

# Examples:
# export dotfiles="$HOME/dotfiles"
# export projects="$HOME/projects"
# export documents="$HOME/Documents"
# export dropbox="$HOME/Dropbox"
